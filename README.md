# mage2-behave

### Introduction

mage2-behave is a project that leverages Python 3.8 and greater for development. The project uses various Python packages to achieve its objectives, with some of the notable ones being selenium, `behave`, `splinter`, `stere` and `webdriver-manager` among others.

This project endeavors to create Magento2/Adobe Commerce projects that are robust, maintainable, and solves real-world problems effectively. Key concepts of software development, such as object-oriented design and clean code, are embraced fully.

The project also exposes you to libraries and frameworks commonly used in Python ecosystem, thereby giving you practical exposure that goes beyond theoretical knowledge.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or an individual in the earlier stages of the Python learning curve, contributing to this project offers a tremendous opportunity to learn, grow and make a difference. 

To get started, make sure you've Python 3.8 or greater installed on your machine alongside the necessary Python packages listed in the requirements file.


### Benefits of Using BDD in a Magento 2 Project

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a powerful approach that aligns software development with business expectations. Utilizing BDD in a Magento 2 project using Python brings numerous benefits:

1. **Communication Enhancement:** BDD enhances communication between developers, stakeholders, and non-technical or business participants. It allows everyone to have a clear understanding of the project requirements.

2. **Focus on the End User:** BDD encourages the team to focus on the end userâ€™s perspective, ensuring that the development process centers around the delivery of features that provide real value to users.

3. **Reduced Ambiguity:** BDD scenarios provide a clear agreement on what is to be delivered, reducing ambiguities and rework.

4. **Regression Detection:** BDD aligns with Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure that all code is covered by tests. This early detection of bugs reduces the cost and time involved in fixing them.

5. **Integration with Agile and Continuous Delivery:** BDD is ideal for Agile development and complements continuous integration and delivery, thereby accelerating product releases and ensuring robust quality.

In essence, utilizing BDD in a Magento 2 project using Python facilitates effective communication, ensures optimal focus on delivering user value, enhances requirement clarity, aids in early bug detection, and promotes seamless integration with Agile and continuous delivery practices.

### Why Python Instead of PHP?

While PHP has served as a strong language for web development over the years, Python offers certain advantages that make it a preferred choice for projects like mage2-behave. Here's why:

1. **Readability and Syntax:** Python follows a strict indentation enforcement, which leads to clear, readable code. Its syntax is designed to be easy to understand and use.

2. **Extensive Libraries:** Python is known for its vast selection of libraries, many of which simplify tasks that would be more complex in PHP, such as scientific computing, machine learning, or image processing.

3. **Versatility:** Python is highly versatile and is not just limited to web development. It can be used to develop a variety of applications, from web and desktop applications to network servers and machine learning algorithms.

4. **Strong Community**: Python has a vibrant community that contributes to a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. This means you are likely to find help or an existing solution to your problem faster than in PHP.

5. **Integration Feature**: Python can be easily integrated with languages like C, C++, and Java, making it a powerful tool for web application development.

Remember, the decision between Python and PHP depends on the requirements of the project, and each has its strengths. However, for mage2-behave, Python's strengths align more closely with the project's goals and needs.
